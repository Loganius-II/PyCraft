# PyCraft

## Developed using ursina (which is really just panda3d)
### The `Executable` folder contains my attempt at making it a distributable package via `.exe` but alass, it doesn't work.
### If anyone can help feel free to speak up
### **UPDATE:** Too many files in the Executables folder so I didn't upload it :(

# Features:
- Fully randomized worlds
- Idk thats pretty much it
- Not very strong engine so don't expect a good frame rate
- I also messed around with some cool shaders
